                        The necessity of quality education for the underprivileged children of Chittagong Hill Tracts
                        was felt for a long time. With the splendid aim of preparing the next generation of this region
                        as responsible and educated citizens of the country the General Officer Commanding of 24
                        Infantry Division and Area Commander of Chittagong area laid the foundation stone of Khagrachari
                        Cantonment Public School & College (KCPSC) on April 27, 2002. The institution was formally
                        inaugurated on December 28, 2005 by Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Moyeen U Ahmed. Maj Asif Iqbal,
                        AEC was the first Principal of the Institution. KCPSC is located right beside Khagrachari
                        Cantonment in an area of 9.42 acre of land surrounded by pictorial / charming green hills. The
                        structural design of the modern state of art buildings of the institution greatly charms
                        visitors. On the north side of the campus there is a hillside lake with a sculpture of white
                        lotus symbolizing beauty and unity of multicultural communities of Khagrachari. The hostel of
                        the institution was built with a view to imparting education to the students living in remote
                        places of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The hostel life is a perfect example of the cultural and
                        ethnic diversity of this region. The four storied hostel building has a capacity of 100
                        students. We have a plan to start Language Club, Debate Club, Music & Dance Club to explore and
                        nourish the hidden potentiality of the young learners. The motto of the institution is to impart
                        education, discipline and morality. It has a flag of navy blue colour with the monogram of the
                        institution in the middle.
